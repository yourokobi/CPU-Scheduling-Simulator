# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator
A Python-based CPU scheduling simulator that implements multiple scheduling algorithms, including Round Robin, Shortest Job Next (SJN), Priority Non-Preemptive, and Shortest Remaining Time (SRT). The simulator visualizes the processes with a Gantt chart and computes key metrics such as waiting time, turnaround time, and completion time.
